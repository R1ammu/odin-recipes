This is a end of the "HTML foundations" course project to see what i learned.
I'm showcasing fundemental understanding of html.

Self reflection: i feel pretty good about the project, i also used the skills of searching (which odin taught me) for things out of the syllbus like tables and center features which i think came in handy and probably will come handy in the future too.
